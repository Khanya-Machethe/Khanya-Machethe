## About Me

Hi there. I’m Khanya. I build **cloud systems** that try to stay alive longer than my houseplants 🌱.  

I’m a 23-year-old tech enthusiast standing at the intersection of **curiosity, caffeine, and chaos**. My days revolve around **cloud computing, systems design, and cybersecurity**, sprinkled with a little **AI wizardry**.  

Some people say, “Start with small projects.” I say, “Start with big dreams and small RAM limits.”  

I’m fascinated by how computers can solve problems while humans argue over where to put the semicolon.

## Philosophy of Tech 🧠

I believe that **good architecture** is like a good joke — if people don’t notice it, it’s working.  

Great systems exist at the crossroads of:  
- 💼 **Business needs** — because no one wants an app that only impresses you at a dinner party.  
- 🛠️ **Technical excellence** — yes, engineers like to feel smart sometimes.  
- 🔐 **Security & scalability** — the digital equivalent of locking your door *and* building a moat.  
- 🤖 **Intelligent automation** — so the system does the thinking while I sip coffee.  

My motto: “If it works perfectly, someone probably didn’t understand the requirements.”

## Cloud Journey ☁️

I’ve been getting my hands dirty in the **cloud** — primarily AWS — and dabbling in multi-cloud scenarios.  

I know the classics: EC2, S3, IAM, Lambda… and yes, I can explain them in a sentence that makes me sound smart at parties.  

### Certifications
- AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner – Foundational  
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate  

> These certifications say, “I know cloud stuff,” but they also say, “I’m not afraid to break it and then fix it.”

I treat every project like a live demo to impress my future self in ten years.

## AI & Intelligent Systems 🤖

AI isn’t just a buzzword — it’s the part of the system that pretends it understands humans better than humans do.  

Areas I enjoy:  
- AI-powered cloud-native applications  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
- Conversational AI & chatbots  
- Automation & decision intelligence  

Some folks integrate AI into a project and call it “intelligent.” I like mine **intelligent enough to refuse bad ideas politely**.

## Technical Skills 🛠️

I’m not claiming to know everything… mostly because I don’t. But here’s my toolbox:  

### ☁️ Cloud & Infrastructure
- AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk, SQS)  
- Multi-Cloud exposure (AWS & GCP)  
- Security fundamentals & identity management  
- Architecture design & best practices  

### 🤖 AI & Automation
- AI chatbots (Amazon Lex)  
- RAG systems with AWS Bedrock  
- Serverless AI integrations  
- Intelligent workflows using Lambda  

### 🔐 Security & Networking
- IAM and least-privilege access  
- Cloud security principles  
- Network planning & design  
- Secure system architecture  

### 🧩 Development & Tools
- Python (yes, whitespace matters)  
- Git & GitHub (merge conflicts included)  
- System documentation  
- Architecture diagrams

## Featured Projects 📌

I like building things that **actually do something** — sometimes more than just light up my terminal:  

- **Smart BankerBot** – AI chatbot using Amazon Lex and Lambda. Teaches users patience one failed transaction at a time.  
- **Smart Conversations: RAG-Powered Chatbot** – Context-aware AI that tries not to answer “yes” to everything.  
- **Cloud Database Solutions** – End-to-end architecture that scales more gracefully than my attention span.  
- **Multi-Cloud Data Transfer (AWS & GCP)** – Secure data movement across clouds because one cloud is never enough.  
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk: Docker Deployment** – Containerized apps that auto-scale like caffeine consumption during finals week.  

> Fun fact: every project doubles as a lesson in humility.

## Career Vision 🎯

I want to become a **world-class Solutions Architect** — someone who can:  
- Design secure, scalable, and resilient systems  
- Treat AI as a first-class citizen  
- Predict failure points before they even happen  
- Turn complex tech into real business value  

I aspire to build systems that work so well that my future self can **actually relax for a few minutes** ☕.

## Learning & Growth 🌱

Even though I’ve done a bit, I’m just getting started:  
- Advanced AWS architecture patterns  
- AI system design at scale  
- Production-grade security practices  
- Making systems *intelligent by default*  

I also occasionally Google “how to adult in tech” just to stay sane.

## Fun Facts 🤫

- I sometimes talk to my server more than people.  
- I’ve broken more cloud environments than I care to admit.  
- My dream is to have an AI that writes commit messages better than I can.  
- I secretly judge bad variable names.  

---

## Let’s Connect 🤝

I’m open to:  
- Cloud & AI collaborations  
- Architecture discussions  
- Learning opportunities  
- Building meaningful, practical solutions  

If my work resonates with you, check out my repos or reach out — I promise my servers won’t judge you.
